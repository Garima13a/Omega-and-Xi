# Omega-and-Xi
To implement Graph SLAM, a matrix and a vector (omega and xi, respectively) are introduced. The matrix is square and labelled with all the robot poses (xi) and all the landmarks (Li). Every time you make an observation, for example, as you move between two poses by some distance dx and can relate those two positions, you can represent this as a numerical relationship in these matrices.
